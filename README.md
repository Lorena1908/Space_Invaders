# Space Invaders
This is a simple Space Invaders game in which the player is the rockeat the bottom and has to kill the little spaceships that are going down. To do that the player will have to shoot them. Every time the player lets one of these spaceships go through the bottom of the screen it loses one life and every time it is hit by the enemy's bullet the green bar below it gets each time more red, and when it's fully red you lose the game and have to start all over again.

## Setup
1. Install the required packages using the following command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Type `python main.py` on the command line to run the program
